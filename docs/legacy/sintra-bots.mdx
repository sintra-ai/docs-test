When purchasing Sintra Bots (previously available in bulk in the Sintra Max bundle), you receive downloadable JSON files that can be imported directly into make.com. 

Along with these files, a setup guide with a video walk-through is provided, making it easy for you to get your automation up and running quickly.

Each bot is designed to automate a specific task. You're welcome to customize the automation scenarios according to your personal needs, but keep in mind that our customer care team is qualified to assist you with the original bot setups only.

There's a one-time fee for purchasing the Sintra Bots for lifetime access, and make.com is free to use for up to 1,000 operations per month. Once you go above that, you only pay per the operations you use to Make. You can find the available pricing plans for make.com at [www.make.com/en/pricing](https://www.make.com/en/pricing).  
​  
In addition, you should have access to OpenAI API credits, so you can use the GPT model of your preference in the bot configuration. You can find information about OpenAI pricing here: [openai.com/pricing](https://openai.com/pricing) If you need additional information or assistance with purchasing API tokens in OpenAI, we suggest reaching out to them directly.

To access the bots included in the Sintra Max bundle, all you need to do is navigate to [app.sintra.ai/legacy](https://app.sintra.ai/legacy) after signing in, choose Bots, select 'View Bot' on the bot you would like to set up, and select the link in step 2 of the setup guide. This step will also include a video walk-through of the setup for that specific bot.
