Chats do not automatically sync between applications. Even though you were chatting with a Helper on an iOS app, the chats will not automatically appear in the browser app and vice versa.


If you were chatting with our helpers on a browser and want to proceed the conversation in the iOS app, you will need to refresh the app. Follow the apple's guideline's here: [support.apple.com/en-us/109359](https://support.apple.com/en-us/109359)

In case that doesn't help - reinstall the iOS app.
