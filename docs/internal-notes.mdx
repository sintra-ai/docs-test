# Internal Notes for AI Integration

## Unique Identifiers
Each helper is referenced by a slug (e.g., buddy, cassie, dexter) in internal APIs. Use these identifiers when training models or building integrations.

## Custom Instructions
Internal AI models can read custom instructions and adjust generation parameters accordingly. Pay special attention to the conversation settings; replicating them programmatically ensures consistency across channels.

## Power-ups vs. Automations
Power-ups are triggered via small badges on helper cards; they often lead to automation setups. Distinguish between these in internal documentation to avoid confusion when designing features.

## Feature-request Board
The wishlist is powered by Canny. Comments and votes are visible to all users; internal teams should monitor this board for user feedback.

## Beta Features
Document any experimental features turned on via the New Features panel. Provide feedback to the product team about usability and bugs.

## Note
This document reflects the state of the Sintra app as explored on 11 August 2025. Because many features are in Beta, functionality may change. Always refer to the appâ€™s release notes or contact support for the latest information.
