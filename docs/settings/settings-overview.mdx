# Settings & Account Management

The Settings page (gear icon) lets you manage personal data, language preferences, security and billing. It is divided into sections:

## Personal Details

Displays your Name, Surname, Email and Job title. The fields are currently read-only; contact support to change them.

## Language Preferences

- **Helpers language**: sets the language your helpers speak in chat (e.g., English). This affects generated responses but not the interface.
- **Interface language**: chooses the language of the Sintra UI. Available options may be limited.

## Security

The Password section includes a button to Change password. When clicked, you’ll be asked to enter your old password and a new one.

## Billing Details

Shows your active subscription plan (e.g., Sintra X – Annual) along with a Manage billing button. Clicking this button opens Sintra’s billing portal (powered by Stripe) where you can view invoices, update payment methods, cancel your plan or switch to a different tier. Note that manually created accounts (not linked to Stripe) may not display this section.

## Experimental Features

Click New features to open a side panel of experimental toggles. Currently there is only one: Helper rooms (Enable new helper rooms experience). Enable or disable it and click Save.

## Feature Requests

Selecting Request a feature opens the public Wishlist page where you can submit or vote on feature ideas. The top of the page provides a form to enter a title, details and category; below are trending posts with vote counts and status labels such as Planned or In Progress. Users can comment on requests and follow updates.

## Help & Support

Click Help & Support to open a chat widget hosted by Cassie (not the same as the customer-support helper). Cassie greets you and offers quick-select buttons like "I have a question," "I’m facing an issue," "I want to ask for a new feature/improvement," "I’m interested in a refund," and "I need to change my login email." Choose an option or type your question; the support team will respond through the chat interface.

## Sign Out

The bottom of the Settings page contains a Sign out button. Click it to end your session.
