  * All customers are eligible for the money-back guarantee.

  * The refund must be requested within 14 days of starting your paid subscription.




## How to Request a Refund

  1. **Contact our support team** within the 14-day period.

  2. **State that you want a refund** and provide any relevant details.

  3. **Cancel your subscription** if you haven't already done so.




**Important:** Canceling your subscription alone does not automatically trigger a refund. You must explicitly request it from our support team.

After submitting your refund request, you will receive a confirmation from our support team. Refunds will be issued back to your original payment method.

## Refund Process

After we receive your refund request:

  * Refunds are typically processed within 5-10 business days - after the refund is issued, the retrieval directly depends on your bank's processing speed.

  * The refund may take additional time to appear in your account depending on your payment method, payment status, and bank policies.




## Additional Information

  * We may ask for feedback about your experience, but this is not mandatory for receiving a refund.

  * The guarantee applies to your initial purchase or subscription start.
