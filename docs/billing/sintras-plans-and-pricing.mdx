We do not offer lifetime plans, only recurring subscription based plans. Since Sintra is powered by AI - each prompt and response costs GPT tokens. Instead of charging you extra to cover created GPT token costs - we already account for these with the subscription's payment. 

This ensures you can stick to a plan suiting your needs, without being charged additional fees! Here's what you need to know:


  1. **Sintra X Plan** : Includes all 12 Sintra Helpers

  2. **Individual Helper Plan** : Includes a single chosen Helper




## Billing Periods

Choose between two billing options:

  * **Monthly subscription**

  * **Annual subscription** (50% cheaper than monthly)




## Pricing

We charge for our plans upfront, meaning, that in order to purchase a subscription, you will need to pay the full price of the term you choose to go with. Here you can see our plan information:

**Plan Type**| **Monthly Price**| **Annual Price**  
---|---|---  
Individual Helper| $39/month| $234/year  
Sintra X| $97/month| $468/year  
  
**Note** : Annual plans are a 50% cheaper compared to monthly billing.
