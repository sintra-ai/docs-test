Upon purchasing Sintra's products, you need to enter an email address. This email becomes associated with your Sintra account and is used to send a confirmation email regarding your successful payment.

If you haven’t received this confirmation and can't access the services you paid for, follow the steps below to resolve your account activation issues.


If you have purchased Sintra's products, but when you're attempting to log in - you get directed to the pricing page instead, do the following:

  1. **First, check your bank statement**. Ensure that the payment has been withdrawn and isn't pending.  
​

  2. If the payment is withdrawn, avoid making a second purchase. Instead, **give our payment provider up to 1 hour** to process the transaction.  
​

  3. Lastly, if the money is withdrawn and an hour has been given for the payment to be processed, but you're still unable to log in - **reach out to our customer support** at the chat in the lower right corner or by emailing us at [help@sintra.ai](mailto:help@sintra.ai). Make sure to attach a screenshot of the bank statement and describe the issue in detail, as it will help us solve your issue faster. 




By following these steps, you should be able to resolve any account activation issues. If you continue to experience problems, our support team is ready to assist you.
