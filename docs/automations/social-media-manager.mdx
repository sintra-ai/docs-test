The Social Media Manager is built atop Soshie (the social media helper) and is currently the most complex automation. It helps create, schedule and post content to connected social accounts.

## Key Features

### Calendar View
After setup, you’ll see a calendar with scheduled posts. You can click any draft to preview its image and caption, then either decline or schedule the post.

### Content Themes
Predefined or custom topics with frequency settings. Sintra suggests themes such as "Behind-the-scenes business operations" or "Repurpose my top-performing posts," each specifying how often to post and on which platform. You can add new themes with custom instructions.

### Custom Instructions
A free-text field where you provide overarching guidelines for your brand (e.g., "Use hashtags; avoid emojis").

### Connected Platforms
Choose which Facebook Pages, Instagram accounts and LinkedIn profiles to publish to. The interface lists all connected accounts with checkboxes.

### How It Works
A help section explaining that Sintra supports single images, carousels and videos; that you must approve posts before publishing; and that drafts are created every Sunday for the coming week. It also reminds you to upload media (photos and videos) through Brain AI or the Social Media Manager itself.

## Setup Steps

1. Click Social Media Manager on the Automations page.
2. Select your Connected platforms (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn). If accounts are not linked, connect them via Brain AI.
3. Define one or more Content themes, specifying the topic, frequency and target platforms.
4. Enter Custom instructions to guide Soshie’s tone and style (e.g., call to action, brand voice).
5. Enable the automation. 

Each week, Sintra will generate draft posts. Visit the calendar to review, decline or schedule them.
