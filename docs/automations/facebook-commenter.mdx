This automation allows Cassie to reply to comments on your Facebook Page. 

## Setup Steps

1. Navigate to Automations and locate the Facebook Commenter card.
2. Click Set up; a form appears with a dropdown to select a connected Facebook Page (you must connect your page through Brain AI integrations first).
3. Use the Additional instructions field to specify the tone or guidelines (e.g., "Keep responses friendly and sign off with our company name").
4. Click Continue to finalize.

Once enabled, Cassie will draft replies to new comments; you must approve each reply before it is posted to Facebook.
