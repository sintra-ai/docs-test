# Experimental & Beta Features

Many Sintra features are labeled Beta and are subject to change. Key points:

## Current Beta Features

- **Helper rooms (experimental)**: this setting toggles a new interface for chats; details are minimal at the moment.
- **Automations are all in Beta**: meaning their workflows, UI and reliability may evolve quickly. Monitor release notes and the feature-request board for updates.

## Important Notes

Internal teams should test Beta features thoroughly before recommending them to external users.
