Sintra is committed to safeguarding customer data by implementing robust security measures and adhering to strict privacy protocols. This article outlines how Sintra ensures data privacy and protection while providing transparency about its practices.

## Security measures

We take your data security seriously and employ advanced security measures to protect customer information at every stage:

  * **Encryption in transit and at rest** : Sintra uses the TLS protocol (1.2 or higher) to ensure secure HTTPS communication. Additionally, where feasible, Sintra encrypts data at rest to offer another layer of protection.

  * **Role-based access control** : Strict access controls are enforced, requiring user authentication through hashed credentials and unique user IDs. These controls ensure that only authorized personnel can access sensitive information.

  * **Monitoring tools** : Sintra utilizes tools such as activity logs, intrusion detection systems, and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions to identify and mitigate potential threats.




## Data retention and minimization Policies

Sintra follows stringent policies to manage data responsibly:

  * **Data Retention** : Customer data is retained only as long as necessary to provide services or comply with legal obligations. Sintra offers the option to permanently delete requested data within 30 days.

  * **Data Minimization** : Sintra adheres to data minimization principles, ensuring that only the necessary amount of data is collected and stored.




## Restricted data usage and third-party access

Sintra follows industry-standard security practices to keep your data and experience private and secure. We take care to limit data usage and prevent unauthorized access:

  * Sintra uses customer data strictly to provide services as described in its [Privacy Policy](https://help.sintra.ai/en/articles/11785619-managing-multiple-projects-using-brain-ai-profiles-in-sintra#) and [Terms and Conditions](https://help.sintra.ai/en/articles/11785619-managing-multiple-projects-using-brain-ai-profiles-in-sintra#). We don't share, sell, or give access to your data to third parties without your consent.

  * Customer email data and other sensitive information are kept private. Sintra does not share this data with third parties, except when you connect third-party apps and give consent. Dedicated tools process user tasks exclusively to provide personalized business solutions.




## Compliance 

Sintra complies with relevant regional regulations and provides additional resources for its users:

  * **EU Data Processing Policies** : Some data processing takes place within the European Union in compliance with regional guidelines.

  * While Sintra is not GDPR certified, we provide a **[Data Processing Agreement](https://sintra.ai/legal/data-processing-agreement?search=support&35444d06_page=2&50c59e3f_page=1)**.
