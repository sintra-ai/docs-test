While your data is encrypted in transit, we recommend taking precautions when uploading sensitive and confidential data to your chats with helpers, power-up materials, and Brain AI.

Before uploading files, remove or change personal and sensitive details, if possible. This allows the helper to process raw data without concern of biases or incidents in case of a security flaw.


If you are not sure about a file, it is best not to upload it. Always err on the side of caution when handling sensitive information.
