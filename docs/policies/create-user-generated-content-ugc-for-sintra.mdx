In addition to Sintra's affiliate program, which can be found [here](https://help.sintra.ai/en/articles/9675436-sintra-ai-affiliate-program), Sintra also offers you the opportunity to provide us with your own user-generated content. To get your content approved by Sintra, follow these guidelines for your video:

  * Film vertically (9:16, 1080px, HDR off)

  * Keep it well-lit & make sure your face is clearly visible

  * Record in a quiet place (no background noise)

  * No filters, color grading, or edits - just the raw footage!

  * Avoid wearing clothing with logos

  * Ensure good contrast between you & your background




Once you're done, simply send your content to [ugc@sintra.ai](mailto:ugc@sintra.ai) via a WeTransfer or Google Drive link. For further information regarding reimbursement, you will be contacted by the Sintra team after your content is approved.

**Disclaimer:** By submitting, you agree that we may use your content for social media and commercial purposes.
