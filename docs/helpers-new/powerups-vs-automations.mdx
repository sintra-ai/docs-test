# Power-ups vs. Automations

Sintra distinguishes between power-ups and automations, and they work very differently:

## Power-ups

Power-ups are mini-apps that run within a chat. They are always accessed via a zap icon (a lightning bolt inside a circle) located in the chat input area. There are two places to trigger them:

### Global Input Card
At the top of the Home page you’ll see a large input field labelled "How can Sintra help you today?" Typing a question here automatically routes it to the right helper. To the right of this field is a zap button. Clicking it opens a side panel listing all available power-ups across all helpers. Choose one (e.g., "Create a carousel post," "Generate a balance sheet") and Sintra will run it in the conversation that opens.

### Helper-specific Chat
Inside any chat, there is a zap button in the lower-right corner of the input field. Clicking it opens a small pop-over showing only the power-ups relevant to that helper. For example, inside Penn’s chat you might see power-ups for blog posts, while inside Dexter’s chat you’ll see analysis tools. Selecting a power-up inserts a structured prompt into the chat and runs it immediately.

Power-ups execute within the conversation—there is no separate dashboard—and you receive the result as a chat message. Power-ups are still evolving and may change over time.

## Automations

Automations are standalone workflows that operate outside of the chat environment. On the Home page some helper cards show a zap icon badge (not a plus sign) in the top right corner; clicking that badge routes you to an automation setup page for that helper. 

Automations run on schedules or monitor external accounts, and they have their own dashboards with settings and metrics. Unlike power-ups, automations always require a setup process and often rely on integrations. 

Currently three automations are available to general users:
- Facebook Auto Commenter
- Social Media Manager
- Daily Summarizer

Other automations, like the Conversation Manager (Emmie inbound replier), are in development or limited to early testers.
