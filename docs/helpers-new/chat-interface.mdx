## Opening a Chat

Clicking a helper card opens a chat room dedicated to that helper. The conversation interface contains:

- The helper’s avatar and name.
- A suggestion card at the top (e.g., "I’ll identify Baltic region expansion opportunities" for Buddy) that you can click to trigger a pre-scripted prompt.
- A large text field for entering your own message.
- Buttons for History (shows previous chats with that helper) and Settings (gear icon) in the top right.

## Conversation Settings

Within any chat, click the gear icon to open Conversation Settings. This modal lets you customize how the helper replies:

### Available Settings

- **Vibe**: a slider ranging from Official to Casual.
- **Message length**: choose Short, Medium or Long.
- **Language**: Basic, Casual or Expert (controls vocabulary and tone). You can also set the response language (e.g., English, Spanish) via the settings page.
- **Search Google toggle**: allows the helper to fetch up-to-date information from the web.
- **Writing Style toggle**: instructs the helper to match your existing content’s tone.
- **Custom instructions**: a free-text field where you can specify additional guidelines. For example, you might say "Always reference our core values; no emoji."

These settings apply per conversation and persist across messages, allowing you to fine-tune the helper’s behavior.
