If you have generated a document, idea, .csv or wish to add information gathered to such file and then save it in the Helper chat - you can do so in the same Helper chat.

You can save files generated by our Helpers to 2 places:

  1. Brain AI memory

  2. Google Drive




## Saving to Brain AI memory

To save to Brain AI, ask the Helper to "save to memory". This feature summarizes the message and only then saves the context in the Brain AI to optimise information on your business retrieval.

To avoid summarization, you would need to save files to Brain AI manually by either:

  1. Copying the Helper's message and pasting it in Brain AI as a snippet;

  2. Saving the message to Google Drive first, downloading it and then uploading it to the Brain AI.




## Saving to Google Drive 

You can save documents either directly to:

  1. The main (root) Google Drive called "My drive";

  2. (New feature) a Helper's personal generated folder.




Note: Files saved in Google Drive cannot be retrieved by Helpers. In order to use a file that is save din Brain AI - you need to upload it directly in the chat.

### Saving to the root Google Drive

To save the document or file, simply ask the helper in chat to "save this to Google drive". You can include a file's name that should be set.

You will receive a pop-up that will ask to confirm this action to be done:

Press "Approve" and the file will be saved to your Google Drive.

Note: If you do not receive a pop-up or click "approve" in the pop-up - the information will not be saved.

### Saving to the Helper's personal Google Drive

Our new functionality now also allows Helpers to create their own folder in Google Drive (one folder per Helper). While this does not allow accessing files - it eases locating the files saved by the Helper within the Google Drive itself.

The process is similar to saving to the root Google Drive; however, in order to also create a folder - you also need to create a file at the same time (at least for the first time).

For the first time, use the following prompt: "Save a a file called [insert the name you want this file to be called] and place it in a new folder called [insert the name of this folder]". 

You will receive a similar pop-up:

The "File Name" will display the placement of the file in this sense : [folder name]/[file name].[format]

Simply click "Approve" and then you will have a folder in your Google Drive that will contain a spreadsheet Helpers will be able to access.

To save files to the same folder in the future, simply ask the Helper the following: "Save this file and place it in a folder called [insert the name of this folder]"
