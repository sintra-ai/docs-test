First, connect your email integrations. Sintra supports these email platforms:

  * [Gmail](https://help.sintra.ai/en/articles/10383940-integrating-your-google-account-to-sintra)

  * [Outlook](https://help.sintra.ai/en/articles/10383990-integrating-your-microsoft-account-to-sintra)




**Tip:** Click on the platform link to view its integration guide.

* * *


After your integration with either Gmail or Outlook is complete, you can use Cassie's chat box to extract your emails on demand. Cassie can find your received emails using 3 different filters - by date, by sender and by subject. Additionally, you can also search for emails that you have sent from either of your inboxes (This feature is still a work in progress).

**Note** : When asking Cassie to retrieve your emails, make sure to mention the platform you want to use, e.g. - Gmail or Outlook.

## Getting emails by date

To get your emails by date, ask Cassie to provide your emails from a specific date (from and to). For example, Cassie will provide me with emails from yesterday:

## Getting emails by sender

Getting your emails by sender, will allow you to filter out specific senders that you want to check. Here, Cassie will retrieve all emails sent from @linkedin.com:  
​

## Getting emails by subject

Requesting Cassie to search emails by subject will make her search for emails that match your request the closest:

## Getting emails with all three filtering options

To retrieve the most specific emails, you can combine all three methods to create a request that will search for a specific subject, from a specific sender at a specific time. This will allow you to make the most precise searches through your inbox:  
​

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/s36tbegb/1521622542/46dd434029fbba639df7c3c24343/image.png?expires=1754573400&signature=02adb1256b621c7ad9375e655001f943773fafb3b2fc2bbb87b25a955588bce4&req=dSUlF898n4RbW%2FMW1HO4zWmVB9Bzb29zAZ1fZ4Pl5NRoa16sQ%2FRHGTyvpOaA%0AIVyx%0A)

**Tip** : Sometimes, Cassie may retrieve too many emails, which causes her processing problems. If you see that happen, break up your request into shorter dates - this way, she will have fewer issues processing the information.

## Getting sent emails (Beta)

Sintra also supports retrieving emails that you have sent. However, due to this functionally being in the Beta stage, it's not possible to retrieve the recipient of the email, as such, only 2 filtering options for it are available - filtering by date and by subject:

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/s36tbegb/1521798918/ccaeb41156193fc083ca0e18d793/image.png?expires=1754573400&signature=bf01b7640600df0322571ea960eb980230a7ed026d23fd9e8527b82895f1bcd4&req=dSUlF853lYheUfMW1HO4zdO0gNtCD5JJfbRTx2hI9%2BpVeo%2B1WYr4RADi0CBB%0APkNR%0A)

# Send emails in chat

Sending emails through Sintra is primarily done through the chat box. Cassie can help you draft new emails or craft professional responses to emails that come to your inbox.

##   
Sending new emails

To draft and send new emails, you will first have to create the emails that you want to send. You can work together with Cassie to draft an email body that fits your needs and requirements:  
​

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/s36tbegb/1521642918/0274d95693d1bbceaf620322abf7/image.png?expires=1754573400&signature=38be30844623e8010e614efcde3a3b0d09cc7caa37da861e5203c8e433fefdbb&req=dSUlF896n4heUfMW1HO4zZ7ot%2FVWb25kRlOgLvKeXfaMF6tq2kWznvmw5RbY%0AWIxM%0A)

Once your draft is created, you'll have to make sure to add a recipient before sending your email. The recipient will be shown at the top of the function window:

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/s36tbegb/1521646222/1ec2ccd8378eaf5912fcee84c8ac/image.png?expires=1754573400&signature=ca6f1ccaed5a9bb1af258a0c3ce2a7496506532bb482b98540b9e9dfb68c4eb3&req=dSUlF896m4NdW%2FMW1HO4zTEIBUNZ1QhIHsqS05ojqZNo9BD1xkfFryD6iYsm%0AruGZ%0A)

  
You can scroll through the function window and double-check the email draft for anything you want to change. If you like the email, press the "Approve" button at the bottom to send it:  
​

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/s36tbegb/1521649291/353472b21af1e2ebc6edd0e6cb4d/image.png?expires=1754573400&signature=2d8447225947d1de61a06267c1510ca58d7202d4bdae0f6e76b838a0b3c70dfb&req=dSUlF896lINWWPMW1HO4zUgdVkmVmuhON4RTxg75gjbhbolD0U4CTgNW4CUX%0AtQqF%0A)

**Note** : If you prefer to change some fields of the email, click the "Cancel" button. The draft will be stopped, and you can ask Cassie to make a new draft with improvements. 

To check if the email was sent successfully, simply check the function window. If the windows changed to a green checkmark, that means it was sent:  
​

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/s36tbegb/1521659147/7c029238d3cf11db1c24df172e1b/image.png?expires=1754573400&signature=98d8812419653c29ce67032abef12f39b25ff5425df1bb93cbe596e9f37496f0&req=dSUlF897lIBbXvMW1HO4zU9Xzh5oJVNhwlpsPWPQtoz2gKODdmxQle4skyQZ%0AQ27n%0A)

  
That's it! You will now know how to send new emails with Cassie using your Gmail or Outlook integration.

## Send reply emails

After retrieving your emails from the inbox using the steps previously shown, you will have the ability to write replies. A reply email can only be sent once the recipient and subject name are known, thus, extracting this information before proceeding is a must. Let's continue from an example used previously:  
​

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/s36tbegb/1521732250/a717e1d48299ae630f73cb6fbefd/image.png?expires=1754573400&signature=ee465ee37d8792f676e46e79c10dd2bc777380309333ff64dacd8a742a84b5bc&req=dSUlF859n4NaWfMW1HO4zS8DMHh3tQ6VPcdUxa1fFq%2BVBe%2FOm0QbNCjPxEgl%0AvTwD%0A)

  
When creating your reply, make sure that the recipient and subject match the original sender and subject name. To check if you're really sending a reply, you can also scroll down in the function window until you find the "Is a reply" text:  
​

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/s36tbegb/1521734972/460c8e1c89f764944f103bbe133f/image.png?expires=1754573400&signature=46ab118f295c4063429aa1e855d1a3987914b06e6be7f74f9ec13d9f5753e754&req=dSUlF859mYhYW%2FMW1HO4zfwnF2Ks2V%2FbRnqcr1xIUGxJD4p2wAgKl%2BCcMZBp%0Aecue%0A)

If "true" is written, that means a reply to the original email will be sent. After approving the email, on a successful reply, the function window will change to a green checkmark:  
​

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/s36tbegb/1521737546/daa529a54092c60c54188466dc16/image.png?expires=1754573400&signature=bd448499d799b30860604414a909b57d8ec2e7b569f592d210c47ff09122dda7&req=dSUlF859moRbX%2FMW1HO4zR6Lhl5JJyabwoEK2OP1fTpoRW0jDVyTIxLl77EN%0A7FIz%0A)

That's it! You will now know how to reply to emails with Cassie using your Gmail or Outlook integration.

## Adding extra recipients using Cc or Bcc

If you would like to add more than one recipient to receive an email, you can ask Cassie to use Cc or Bcc. When making your request, include the extra recipients and add which method to use:  
​

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/s36tbegb/1521748448/89bffcf4ed4c21ad0d8939a96d89/image.png?expires=1754573400&signature=ff3e20aefb1ce2d0d42e0ba83a3d259d5890a81815cc793d971d426c3dac45aa&req=dSUlF856lYVbUfMW1HO4zV5xXlYYzJ0b58GN76ujQ6GWkOwLBnqq8UwlSGHO%0Ahe9v%0A)

  
A successful Cc or Bcc will be shown inside the function window after scrolling down:  
​

# FAQ

### Can I use 3rd party emails that are connected through Gmail or Outlook?

Unfortunately, emails connected to your Gmail or Outlook accounts via SMTP, POP3 or IMAP protocols won't be supported. Sintra currently uses the Google and Outlook APIs without these extra functionalities integrated.

### Can I use a Google Workspace email?

Yes, Sintra does support Google Workspace emails. However, you will have to ask your Workspace admin to enable trusted permissions for the Sintra integration. These permissions are required for the successful integration of Sintra to your account. More information can be found on Google's website [here](https://support.google.com/a/answer/7281227?hl=en).

### Can I view and add attachments to my emails?

Sintra only supports basic emailing features in the chat at this time:   
1\. Reading emails (by date, sender, subject)  
2\. Sending emails (text)

Adding or receiving attachments through the chat is not possible.
