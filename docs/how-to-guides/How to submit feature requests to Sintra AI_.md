## Requesting features by email

If you wish to request features by contacting us directly, create an email to [help@sintra.ai](https://g%20help@sintra.ai.), describe what feature or upgrade you'd like to see and our team will log this request for you! The more details you give on the request, for example, what functionality you want to see and why, the better the execution if the request gets picked by the product team.

We deeply appreciate our user's input as Sintra's goal is to help you with our services; however, we cannot guarantee that all of the requests made will be executed.
