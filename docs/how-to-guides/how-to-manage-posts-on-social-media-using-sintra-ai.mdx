Sintra AI is designed to help you create and post Social Media content from one place ensuring the app is easy-to-use and the social media post management is easy-to-maintain!

You can enjoy the social media post management benefits with our helper Soshie.

[Learn more about Soshie](https://help.sintra.ai/en/articles/9612920)

** _Note_** _: other Helpers are unable to manage social media posts. This skill is available only for Soshie._

To start managing your Social Media channels with Sintra, you will have to connect Social Media integrations first. Currently, Sintra supports these Social Media platforms for post scheduling and posting:

  * [Facebook + Instagram](https://help.sintra.ai/en/articles/10384189-integrating-your-facebook-instagram-account-to-sintra)

  * [LinkedIn (Personal)](https://help.sintra.ai/en/articles/10383803-integrating-your-linkedin-personal-account-to-sintra)

  * [LinkedIn (Organization)](https://help.sintra.ai/en/articles/10383905-integrating-your-linkedin-organization-account-to-sintra)




**Tip:** Click on the platform link to view its integration guide.

There are 2 ways to manage your social media post generation and/or scheduling:

  1. An automated solution to generate social media posts periodically

  2. A manual approach to generate social media posts via Soshie's chat




While both solutions enable preparing content in bulk - the key difference between them is that the automated solution requires a lot less input from you, optimizing the social media post management for all connected socials overall, while Soshie's chat requires more input and prompting but enables posting or scheduling single posts.

# Periodic post generation and scheduling with Soshie

If you wish to allow Soshie more autonomy and step away from crafting each social media post - periodic scheduling feature is the best approach for you. This is our latest feature released: an all-in-one solution enabling our Helper to craft a social media strategy according to your needs, vision and context gathered in Brain AI. 

This solution requires a lot less input from you: simply clarify a few questions and approve generated posts placed in a in-app social media calendar; however, for it to work well - it's essential you fill Brain AI with information on your business first.

## Setting up periodic post generation for the first time

The first time you start using this feature, you will need to go to Soshie's chat and click on "Activate weekly posts":  
​

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/s36tbegb/1599167105/3e8153bb91e3bae540da677d5641/Screenshot+2025-07-02+at+12_41_44.png?expires=1754573400&signature=995e97595eac52d3b642bc34b6b2f8e94ec68eb3543056dcfb3eaf8bcd558583&req=dSUuH8h4moBfXPMW1HO4zcv7dExo0BGWWRspT43me%2FFNn3S7hZMrjCnCkL%2BR%0AhzpM%0A)

Once you do - Soshie will need to clarify some details on your social media pages and business. Then you will have the option to upload media (videos and images) to use or skip this step to generate images for you. After this - you will be able to work on other thinks or navigate the app usually and will simply receive a notification in the Inbox when the generated posts will need your review!

You will be able to see the overview of Soshie's generated posts and assigned dates for publishing in the calendar view. There, you will be able to review the posts, adjust them if you'll want to and approve or delete them.

## Reviewing periodically generated social media posts

After setting up the periodic post generation, you will need to review each post with a label "Needs approval" and approve it so it's actually considered scheduled. If a post is not approved - it will not be actually scheduled.

You can review posts by:

  * Clicking on the individual post in the social media post content calendar view

  * Clicking on "x posts to review" tab in the social media post calendar view

  * Going to the inbox, which holds all of the tasks requiring your attention, and clicking on "x posts to review"




During approval process, you can see the image that will be posted along with the caption, date scheduled and the social media page it will be posted to. In this stage you can adjust the following:

  1. The media used for a post - if the image used or generated is not to your liking, you will be able to upload other media from Brain AI next or instead of the existing media;

  2. The caption of the post

  3. The social media and it's page it will be posted to

  4. The date of the post going live




From here, you will simply need to approve or decline the post generated:

  * To schedule the post and confirm the information is to your liking - click "Approve"

  * To remove the generated post from the content calendar and ensure it does not get scheduled - click "Decline"

Once approved, the post will no longer have a yellow "Needs approval" label, instead it will have a green "Scheduled" label:

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/s36tbegb/1623832440/5440ccc96e8012bde40a7da8588f/Screenshot+2025-07-16+at+20_24_40.png?expires=1754573400&signature=c2b96b93022313f8a7dd82c4f7eba9a5d429ff3e21cb4b73993be5c5cba9d5a6&req=dSYlFcF9n4VbWfMW1HO4zVPkIrLFbIBPZVi7rbkdNqX4jI3jlPDFxfONUuN%2B%0AFAux%0A)

**Tip** : to quickly adjust the date the post is scheduled to go live on - simply drag and drop the post in the post calendar view. This can be done with both approved and needing approval posts.

That's it! You will be prompted to upload content for future posts and receive new generated posts on a weekly basis.

# Manual post generation and scheduling in Soshie's chat

If you wish to be more involved hands-on in social media post creation and/or scheduling - you can do so when utilising Soshie's chat. 

The chat is accessible in 2 ways:

  1. After clicking Soshie's card from the home screen

  2. After going to the social media calendar view and clicking the "+" sign above the calendar




In chat, Soshie can craft creative images and diverse descriptions according to your prompt. However, you need to be clear, provide details and the expectations if you have a certain vision.

This option will require being aware of social media integration and platform capabilities as well as provide more details right of the batt to avoid potential confusion.

Since you can converse with our Helpers via the chat interface in free-form -**it's important to be clear on what you want to achieve.** For example, clarify the social media you want to post to, what format should it be done in (for example, if you wish an Instagram story to be posted or a post). If you have certain expectations that the Helper should meet - be clear about them as well as the vision you have. This will ensure a smoother process and experience overall.

In regards of social media post management, in the chat you can:

  1. Either generate images with Soshie or upload your own images for social media posts _;_

  2. Provide the post context you wish the helper would focus on and receive generated post descriptions according to it as well as the context in your Brain AI;

  3. Either post the prepared social media posts straight away or schedule them for later.




When a post is ready to be scheduled or posted - you need to receive a pop-up that prompts you to either:

  * Decline a post by clicking "Decline".

  * Post something straight away by clicking "Approve".

  * Schedule a post by clicking "Schedule for later".




**_Note:_**_if you're outlining a social media plan with Soshie in a chat - it's important the posts are scheduled after clicking the "schedule for later" button, as otherwise, the social media posts will not be scheduled and posted._

The posts successfully scheduled in Soshie's chat will be available in the social media content calendar, that you can access in Soshie's chat after clicking "View post calendar".

Now that you're familiar with the overall concept of managing social media posts via Soshie's chat, et's dive into the specific steps!

## Creating posts

To create more engaging posts for your audience, you should include visual imagery that captures attention and tells your story. Sintra offers you two options: 

  1. Image generation or 

  2. Using your own images.​




### Generating images with Sintra

To start generating images for your posts - open a chat with Soshie and provide her with your request:

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/s36tbegb/1599113992/ce3536b0880c08893ca85cb969dd/Screenshot+2025-07-02+at+12_09_10.png?expires=1754573400&signature=02843f00e9894343db764781634b83ac48630b4c9c455286048fe121296476e1&req=dSUuH8h%2FnohWW%2FMW1HO4zfdV6qQdHHcGTGRnm5SwCIBIXMhz1%2FA1KDVEHfK7%0Aon2J%0A)

To ensure better image generation and alignment with your expectations, provide information on what you want to see in the image: items, colors, placement. If you expect certain text on top of the image - clarify the font, color, make sure to wrap the specific words with quotation marks. You can even include the social media or the format you want the post generated for!

Soshie will use your request to generate a detailed prompt, which is then be sent to the AI image generator to craft an image. You can use images generated this way for your public posts.

**Note** : if you wish to edit a previously generated image - clarify to the Helper that they should use this generated image and specify the details you want changed.

###   
Uploading images to Sintra

You can also use your own images for Soshie to use when creating posts. To upload an image to chat, use the paper clip icon inside the chat box: 

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/s36tbegb/1599127149/e5f602c584b327f894051089211a/Screenshot+2025-07-02+at+12_13_35.png?expires=1754573400&signature=53ad708633ff1e8d2446ae4b9c071e8028230bbd56353bb4145efb9c4343bad2&req=dSUuH8h8moBbUPMW1HO4zStdH1YNq2S4D0%2B69FK4bmw80cr5VnniD9EyLofN%0AKFNy%0A)

  
After choosing your file, you must write inside the chat box to upload the picture to chat. Here is an example of Soshie describing the image we generated previously in a different chat:  
​

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/s36tbegb/1599128389/79331cc004d0c2703101b67eceee/Screenshot+2025-07-02+at+12_16_05.png?expires=1754573400&signature=1e639e85f7c80092856f140775f44677119823fee9787d7b5fc77ae68d403ac1&req=dSUuH8h8lYJXUPMW1HO4zbPsJHGTDfqhK%2Bqj2nUXVwgQ0r7sCynE%2Bx0FEtsd%0Avedy%0A)

When you're ready to publish your post - it will use the uploaded image.

### Creating post content with Soshie

After generating your image or uploading it, you can move on to drafting the post content itself. Simply ask Soshie to craft a draft post for you. If you have any expectations for the post description (topic, hashtags, social media to optimise for, format, alignment with the image) include it all in the same message:  
​

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/s36tbegb/1599135202/5565b72b64086e88f3cb55b25ca7/Screenshot%2B2025-07-02%2Bat%2B12_17_02.png?expires=1754573400&signature=2eff750ed9d41a1db0ae96a13c1e25426cb0c002e11731bd5602e8ba032ac37b&req=dSUuH8h9mINfW%2FMW1HO4zXZnkvx0qSSWkuBeLVgoF8nGoG4yxSNPDRRoNsBp%0AyZ97%0A)

The content body will be created using the information inside your Brain AI and tailored to your request. You can share feedback and request changes, if there are specific details you want to change - clarify them. Once the post aligns with your expectations - you can move on to post publishing or scheduling.

##   
Publishing Posts

Once your image and content are ready, you can start publishing your post to Social Media. Currently, Sintra supports either publishing the post instantly or scheduling it for later.

**Note** : LinkedIn and Facebook posts can be published without any images - Instagram posts will require images to be published.

### Publish posts and stories instantly

Once you have the social media post ready - prompt Soshie to "post it" and clarify the social media platform and which page you want the post or story to be published on:

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/s36tbegb/1599151297/9830d62907539cf5f565ac3d602f/Screenshot+2025-07-02+at+12_32_04.png?expires=1754573400&signature=ee20db09e663cf1f3c5291d6704c2bfc8161ced7dd1d96834551f3ede79a2246&req=dSUuH8h7nINWXvMW1HO4zTFjlwRCEmpSEQOabt9p5W5NaTAf0mQgn64ytaGO%0A1qwS%0A)

Soshie will generate a drop-down box that will require your input. At the bottom of the box, you will see the "Approve" button, clicking this will publish the post to your page instantly:

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/s36tbegb/1464903608/57b98136c6d466a6bbd852c6c4ca/image.png?expires=1754573400&signature=ef823826241a53143ad94a459ae7cdc37b16cf38286b0b8fcc4552fa42c3b63c&req=dSQhEsB%2BnodfUfMW1HO4zeerKi5rDcbFUf4Rhp2RoG1iUfJL69CWAP1Rrnvp%0AgyJl%0A)

  
If the post or story was published successfully, the drop-down menu will reflect that with a checkmark:

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/s36tbegb/1464947704/37b1f0e5825d8b19e013eba0d4d1/image.png?expires=1754573400&signature=838b5ede20c48ac6b7f7210e46ee2af3b9a79ca9246863cf7a2d11c34ea2d8d4&req=dSQhEsB6moZfXfMW1HO4zeXywpSujuD%2BcXCIrd7ECDYogFJRv5%2B6MvgV7ngm%0ARadC%0A)

  
That's it! Your post or story will now be public on the platform you posted it on. The posts successfully published in Soshie's chat will also be visible in the social media content calendar, that you can access in Soshie's chat after clicking "View post calendar".

**Tip** : After making your first request to post, Soshie may need to locate your Social Media pages. If this happens, simply make your request again.

### Schedule posts

To schedule posts that you just created, instead of clicking "Approve" - find the "Schedule for later" button: This button is located below the "Cancel" and "Approve" options. When clicked, a calendar interface will appear, allowing you to select a specific publication date and time for your post.

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/s36tbegb/1464918983/192d5c76e2e5bc13e5bda48f3edb/image.png?expires=1754573400&signature=faa44a1e0466deadfd96b072a22e061e061697b4255d28bd8b46c9a5027adf6b&req=dSQhEsB%2FlYhXWvMW1HO4zTuAt82acY38AbyJ%2BrmpgkspK6hDj%2FzZ%2FVHXzu1e%0Auyjc%0A)

This button will open a menu where you can choose the day and time for your post:

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/s36tbegb/1464924539/d171f26cea07f8550a8ab867a649/image.png?expires=1754573400&signature=3a2f9d8ffcd1bb42a9f9b65370998e904ae98ef9758d8f7022ab980528235a83&req=dSQhEsB8mYRcUPMW1HO4zc6IcKCTlmN57brgl0LHWfGF60Bypt%2F7fdE2dRK1%0AedvU%0A)

If the scheduling is successful - the drop-down box will change to reflect the date and time: 

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/s36tbegb/1464929561/b60129b656015aed1c7d5b7dfe5f/image.png?expires=1754573400&signature=c2ae8eacdc96a17828781551b99a4f437efd59a2eb8b6e979f2d3db9331ed56f&req=dSQhEsB8lIRZWPMW1HO4zR1YxnNqcM5LTzxN6qteJH9T9fXhQYm4gITat%2FRt%0AKktF%0A)

That's it! The scheduled post will now be posted on the date you chose! The posts successfully scheduled in Soshie's chat will be available in the social media content calendar, that you can access in Soshie's chat after clicking "View post calendar".

# FAQ

### What picture types and aspect ratios are supported?

Sintra supports PNG, JPEG, and JPG formats for picture uploads inside the chat. The current aspect ratios that can be used in chat are 1:1, 4:3 and 9:16. If you upload a picture that does not fit these aspect ratios, the picture will be cropped to the closest available size. If you wish to use a picture of any size for your posts, try using our Social Media auto-poster instead.

### How long can my posts be?

Whether you are posting directly from chat or scheduling your posts, make sure that they are under 2000 characters in length. We have this limit to have a unified system in place for all platforms we support.

### Can I create reels for Facebook or Instagram?

Sintra cannot create or post reels for you at this moment. However, you can use existing video files (up to 1 minute long) within the automation feature to schedule and post video content on Facebook and Instagram.

### Can I post Instagram stories?

Sintra supports Instagram Story posting only for Instagram Business accounts. Instagram Creator accounts aren't able to post stories at this time.

### Can I post in Facebook groups?

Sintra does not support posting directly to Facebook Groups. The only channel currently supported to publish posts on is Facebook pages. This ensures that all content created and posted using Sintra stays aligned with Facebook's group management policies while enabling streamlined publishing to Facebook pages.

### I planned social media posts with Soshie and approved them, but they weren't posted. Why?

Even though you may confirm the action for Soshie by a message to the chat - the system is set up in a way that you would need to click the button to either "Approve" to post now or "Schedule for later" to schedule a post. Otherwise, the posts will not be posted.  
​

If you have scheduled the posts - they will be visible in the social media content calendar, that you can access in Soshie's chat after clicking "View post calendar".
