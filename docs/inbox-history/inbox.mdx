The Inbox collects items that require your attention. It is divided into two tabs:

## To-do Tab

Actionable tasks triggered by helpers or automations. Examples include:
- "Answer 30 questions" (from Brain AI)
- "Review 5 posts" (from Social Media Manager)
- "Check your day’s summary" (from Daily Summarizer)

Each task links to the relevant part of the app where you can complete it.

## Ideas Tab

Proactive suggestions from helpers, such as:
- "Buddy suggests exploring a new market"
- "Seomi recommends optimizing these pages"

Ideas serve as inspiration rather than mandatory tasks and may expire after a short time; a small timer shows when they’ll disappear.

Think of the Inbox as your action centre: whenever an automation drafts something or Sintra requires input, it surfaces here so you don’t miss it.
