The History panel (clock icon) stores all conversations across every helper. It features:

## Search and Organization

- A search bar to find past chats by keyword.
- Sections such as Pinned, Today, Last 7 days and Older.
- For each conversation: the helperâ€™s avatar, the conversation title (typically your first question) and a snippet of the most recent response.

## Pinning Conversations

You can pin important conversations so they always appear at the top of History. Selecting any entry reopens that chat exactly where you left off, regardless of which helper it was with.
