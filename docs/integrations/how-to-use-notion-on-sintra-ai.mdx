After your integration with Notion is finished, you can use the Helper's chatbox to manage Notion pages straight from chat. To use Notion with Sintra optimally, you will need to make sure that your Helper knows which pages it has access to through the integration.  
​  
To begin with, you can think of Notion's internal structure as a tree - one page can hold multiple different pages, which then branch out to many others. Each page has an identification code that only it is assigned. These codes are used by the Helpers to find the correct pages to work on after you make a request. To make sure that your Helper is identifying the correct pages to manage, you will need to ask it to check available pages at the start of the conversation:

**Note:** Whenever you open a new conversation, you will need to ask the Helper to check all available pages, as identification information is not carried through chats.   
​  
Additionally, if you have been working with a Helper for a long time, they may forget the identification code of the pages that were rarely used - try asking them to check your pages again to retrieve the code.

If you do not use this method to retrieve all workable pages, you may notice your Helper underperforming or performing requests on random pages. Extracting identification information is like giving a map to the Helper for better navigation.

# Create and update Notion pages and databases

Now that the Helper knows how to navigate your Notion workspace, you'll be able to create new child pages or update already existing ones. All of this can be completed inside the chat with the assistance of your Helper.

**Important:** Helpers cannot create new parent(root) pages inside your Workspace. Due to limitations, only child(branching) pages can be created.

## Create a page

To start creating a Notion page, provide your Helper with the place where a new page should be created, and give the page a name:  
​

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/s36tbegb/1576958950/93ff06ef6434e1be5cde6e171368/image.png?expires=1754573400&signature=815f55cd0a9ae195739c8faa83937622cbba27f97d86ff30565465076bee7627&req=dSUgEMB7lYhaWfMW1HO4zYCr6NmrISR4NAhxMpbaAKme%2BfsIYX%2FJ1mSov4%2BE%0Al%2FtF%0A)

  
If the creation was successful, the loading wheel will change into a check mark, and the Helper should provide you with a link to your new page:

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/s36tbegb/1576961519/ffcf9b6cc57a66ff5214da41da14/image.png?expires=1754573400&signature=ddbf335f6c65b5dec56772c77f4bbb312c30b3ce312ebaf6a08f36c1eb548f00&req=dSUgEMB4nIReUPMW1HO4zSkli0rH6ad4XwARcigb2VHXzBnsaAgI%2BZou7Vho%0A%2F0Ir%0A)

That's it! Creating new pages using Sintra is a very simple process - just make sure to provide clear instructions.  
​

## Create a database page

In addition to creating pages, Helpers can also help you create new databases. Simply repeat the steps as if you were creating a normal child page, just change it to a database: 

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/s36tbegb/1576970874/9e56728a4ff2c5bd99d8d6cd320b/image.png?expires=1754573400&signature=6ef67a6f0358f02d557bb999fcc1908826e3f0ef33035028b403342388ee8948&req=dSUgEMB5nYlYXfMW1HO4zctuHkMgJp8r2NfsWa6LJQOnU%2B787eTg9UPJeYM9%0AFCPj%0A)

If you want to create a database with different properties, include the properties that should be added:

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/s36tbegb/1578712172/4182ad0be26961c29e00b6dfe6bd/image.png?expires=1754573400&signature=a5029292a7b1a80bea5be49aee9035898bf03537c109df5c3c8ad5a523610b94&req=dSUgHs5%2Fn4BYW%2FMW1HO4zTfP81OPo%2FQxyOhmZGYGgrcs6JEZ%2FAsz%2FWmUtjo4%0AwB5g%0A)

Here's the final result:

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/s36tbegb/1578712706/931b70aea2e0ed2c5a0a87ebadb6/image.png?expires=1754573400&signature=05570050cbad68e86ae69241bccbc601388489145122f5cc437a861bf74998ac&req=dSUgHs5%2Fn4ZfX%2FMW1HO4zdQFFmMuNSZg5FNkYEqky623Kc4jDI7EvFejgp2L%0AfqUG%0A)

**Limitation:** Currently, the Notion integration cannot update your database properties after the page has been created. If you want to use different properties, include them when you're creating your database for the first time.

## Update a Notion page

A normal Notion page is currently limited to these updates:

  * Managing text

  * Creating new pages




Managing text means that the Helper can post content to a specific Notion page that you request:

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/s36tbegb/1577036372/5656ab4bd7446b8315857ef6904a/image.png?expires=1754573400&signature=ea0fd85d1f6f1d5e370792715120ff7bf18a1427a2f5cd534c3c1c6e12959c4c&req=dSUgEcl9m4JYW%2FMW1HO4zfDgOJmJZ7c45m82x%2B1qpFv0doQNeyXfg6QYBJz6%0A5clv%0A)

  
Here is how the example poem would look in Notion:  
​

**Note:** Managing text is currently limited to creating new text only. Editing or removing text will have to be done by hand.

## Update a database page

When you create a database inside Notion, you will be able to use our integration to create new entries inside it. For this example, I will be using "branch database two" with properties - Name, Contact email, Description, and Time created.

To add new entries, use the chat with your Helper and include which entries have which information:

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/s36tbegb/1578774976/53f3c7656d96a598f213bfad742f/image.png?expires=1754573400&signature=defa468a8b74cbc14a1c776e0679ed151aed64de09bb2212af7b3a815c136f6c&req=dSUgHs55mYhYX%2FMW1HO4zeV7dEmJfZAML3qrd%2FMKq%2FKHcVxholcfxKKmo%2F1X%0APpm8%0A)

The result in Notion will look like this:

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/s36tbegb/1578775629/576e8d01b99fcdb5193a82145058/image.png?expires=1754573400&signature=1573924fa55ad446eec7a34e62425bc4038ec08e8e7a8dd182b22f32e63af74e&req=dSUgHs55mIddUPMW1HO4zfIDdEntdGSfDf9UOfFUcAZaqXzE8J9PQ5CAqFLK%0ALy4l%0A)

**Limitation:** Only one entry can be handled by the Notion integration at a time. Trying to request more than one entry at a time will result in failure.

# Read Notion pages and databases

Since Notion is a productivity and note-taking application, you may want to check information or notes you took before. Helpers can also help you with that, and the process is quite simple.

**Note:** Helpers aren't meant to locate pages that hold specific information. Reading a page or a database means returning information from an already known source.

## Read a Notion page

To retrieve information from a Notion page, you will need to point the Helper to the correct page. Make sure that the Helper is aware of all the pages that they have access to. Then, clarify the exact name of the page that you want to retrieve information from. In my example, I ask it to retrieve the poem from "branch page one": 

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/s36tbegb/1583939069/36d4938c2e8d61a6b076f87c86f8/image.png?expires=1754573400&signature=71ddf56c93e76595c02ca4b642ede021eaac097706339bfddd36012a7213a487&req=dSUvFcB9lIFZUPMW1HO4zfG9a%2BHdewk2SDlRHdjhMBclcx7lzELmLMR5HIQ0%0AujRD%0A)

##   
Read a Notion database page

The principle to retrieve database page information is also the same as retrieving information from the normal pages. This time, I'll ask Gigi to extract the entries from "branch database two":

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/s36tbegb/1583945089/f30887dc6f6a8c934f4b95f13058/image.png?expires=1754573400&signature=329eb4b1ac0da094238b886f6af2174a12b4911858ca6a3592cfc4c085a74a95&req=dSUvFcB6mIFXUPMW1HO4zU40HkqC74Vd3LBTPU6LBmCw8r7HvYWhGVUxD7h5%0ANnZk%0A)

Both entries from my example database were returned. That means the request was successful.

# FAQ

### Why can't I create parent pages with Sintra?

To create a new page using the Notion API, it's required to assign the page a parent identification number. Since a workspace does not have a parent ID, it's impossible to create parent pages using the integration. This limitation comes from Notion itself.

### How do I grant access to the new parent pages that I created?

When you create new root/parent pages inside Notion, you will need to re-grant access to Sintra for those pages to be managed. Follow these steps to do it:  
  
1\. Click the drop-down arrow inside your Notion workspace.

![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/s36tbegb/1584156799/0c221b51603b4da129026033ae12/image.png?expires=1754573400&signature=f7219c781f218c7b635a268feea942e0c77ea0e4c327b5c131848732e5503741&req=dSUvEsh7m4ZWUPMW1HO4zYY4Y7vvPiBr%2Bo698bjkyZ%2BI0%2B%2BP0iIPYBS1qgoZ%0Ac13e%0A)

2\. Press the "Settings" button.

5\. Click "Select page access".

6\. Select the pages you want to integrate - a blue checkmark will appear.
