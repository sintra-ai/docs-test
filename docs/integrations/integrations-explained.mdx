While Sintra does not provide API capabilities, which means there is no available API keys that can be used to connect to other services or platforms - Sintra supports multiple integrations within the app itself. Integrations allow your Sintra Helpers to connect with third-party tools, retrieve data, and complete tasks on your behalf. This guide will show you how to connect and use integrations effectively.

## Connecting Integrations

To connect an integration:

  1. Go to the [Brain AI](https://app.sintra.ai/brain) page and choose a profile

  2. Find the Integrations section

  3. Select the integration you want to connect

  4. Follow the prompts to authorize the connection




**Important:** Integrations are associated with the Brain AI profile you add them on. You can add access to different accounts for different Brain AI profiles.

**Tip** : if you need to connect a different account than the one previously connected, sign in to the platform (e.g. Facebook) in a separate tab and try adding the connection in Brain AI again.

## Using Integrations

Once connected, integrations enable your Helpers to perform specific functions. Here are a few examples:

  * **LinkedIn:** Share posts on your behalf

  * **Google/MS Calendar:** Read event details and create new events

  * **Gmail:** Create email replies 




**Tip:** Check the [Brain AI](https://app.sintra.ai/brain) page for a complete list of _available functions_ for each integration. Each integration card provides detailed information about its capabilities.

To use an integration, simply chat with your Helper and ask them to perform a task. For example:

  * "Create a new event in my Google Calendar for tomorrow at 2 PM"

  * "Extract all unread emails from my Gmail inbox"

  * "Share a post on my LinkedIn profile"




Your Helper will automatically use the appropriate integration based on your request and the context of your conversation.

[Connecting Instagram accounts to Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/connect-instagram-to-page)

**Note** : during onboarding and in Brain AI settings, you will notice that the connections are being added to email addresses associated with your personal accounts (for LinkedIn (Organization), Facebook & Instagram). This is intentional, as you are adding a connection to an account that owns or has linked the pages you want the helpers to work on. They do not have permission to submit posts on your personal Facebook feed. Once the connection is added, you will be able to specify the pages you want the helpers to work on in your automation setups and in chats with the helpers.

## Contextual Accuracy

When using integration functions, Helpers consider multiple factors to provide more accurate and relevant results:

  1. The context from your chat thread

  2. Information from your [Brain AI](https://intercom.help/sintralabs/en/articles/9607409-brain-ai-explained) profile about your brand

  3. The specific integration's capabilities

Your security and privacy are our top priorities when it comes to integrations and all data you share with Sintra:

  * **Consent-based actions:** Helpers will never post or make changes to your accounts without your explicit consent. You always have full control over what actions are taken.

  * **Data protection:** No third party, apart from Sintra, has access to your data. All intellectual property and private business data shared with our AI assistants remains exclusive to your own workspace and is securely stored in Brain AI.

  * **No training on your data:** Your data is never used to train or refine AI models. It's only used to personalize your own experience.

  * **User controls:** You can manage your data through settings under Brain AI, including the ability to delete uploaded materials or clear memory.

  * **Transparent operations:** Helpers will always inform you about the actions they're about to take and ask for your approval before proceeding with any integration-related tasks.




By leveraging integrations, you can streamline your workflow and allow your Sintra Helpers to manage various tasks across different platforms seamlessly, all while maintaining consistency with your brand and preferences, and ensuring your data remains secure.
