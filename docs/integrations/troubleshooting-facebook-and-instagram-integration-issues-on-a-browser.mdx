Integrations occasionally encounter issues, such as connection errors or configuration challenges. The following article focuses on Facebook+Instagram integration-specific troubleshooting, addressing common problems and providing actionable solutions.


If you've added the wrong Facebook account to Sintra, follow these steps to remove it and start over:

  1. Go to the Brain AI tab and click on an integration you want to remove.

  2. Click "Disconnect" and you will remove the Facebook and Instagram connection from your Sintra account.

  3. Open an Incognito or Private window in your browser.

  4. Log into your Sintra account at [Sintra App Login](https://app.sintra.ai/).

  5. Reconnect the appropriate Facebook Business account.




## Troubleshooting auto-login and connection issues

If Sintra auto-logins to an unwanted Facebook or Instagram account, connection seems to fail or the integration option does not allow you to add a new account, try these solutions:

  * **Use Incognito or private mode**

    1. Open an Incognito/Private tab in your browser. Cookies won’t be saved, preventing auto-login to the wrong account.

    2. Visit [Sintra App Login](https://app.sintra.ai/login) and sign in.

    3. Navigate to the Sintra Brain AI page and attempt to reconnect the desired account.  
​

  * **Use a different browser**

    1. Launch a browser that doesn’t store saved login information.

    2. Sign into Sintra as usual and reconnect the required account.  
​

  * **Sign out from all facebook accounts and clear cache and cookies completely**

    1. Log out of all your Facebook accounts on your current browser.

    2. Clear saved cookies and browser cache completely.

    3. Log into [Sintra App Login](https://app.sintra.ai/login) and retry the integration process.




## Troubleshooting Facebook and Instagram post draft visibility

  1. **Verify your Instagram-Facebook connection** : Ensure your Instagram Business or Creator profile is linked to a Facebook Page via the Meta Business Suite.  
​

  2. **Reconnect the integration**

     * Remove the existing connection in **[the Brain AI tab](https://app.sintra.ai/brain)** by clicking on an integration you want to remove and then clicking "Disconnect".

     * Re-add the connection in an **Incognito browser mode**.  
​

  3. **Check Facebook Business integrations**

     * Log in to Facebook.

     * Go to **Settings & Privacy > Your Activity and Permissions > Business Integrations**.

     * Locate Sintra in the listed apps and click **View and Edit**.

     * Ensure all toggles for permissions are enabled.




## Troubleshooting Facebook page linking issues

If you're facing issues with Facebook page linking to Instagram or directly to Sintra

  1. V**erify Instagram-Facebook connection**

     * Confirm that your Instagram Business or Creator profile is linked to a managed Facebook Page via Meta Business Suite.  
​

  2. **Reconnect the integration**

     * Remove the existing connection in **[the Brain AI tab](https://app.sintra.ai/brain)** by clicking on an integration you want to remove and then clicking "Disconnect".

     * Re-add the connection in an **Incognito browser mode**.  
​

  3. **Check Facebook permissions** :

     * Log in to Facebook.

     * Navigate to **Settings & Privacy > Your Activity and Permissions > Business Integrations**.

     * Locate Sintra under active apps and choose **View and Edit**.

     * Switch on all required permissions.




## Integration limitations

While Sintra supports an extensive range of integrations, there are a few limitations to its functionality:

  * Sintra operates exclusively within its platform and does not support external tools like Airtable or custom drives apart from Google Drive.

  * Posting to platforms like Instagram or LinkedIn must be done directly through the app, as sharing from external tools is restricted.




## Summary

To effectively manage Facebook account integrations in Sintra, ensure you:

  * Remove incorrect accounts before starting over.

  * Use Incognito mode, different browsers, or clear cookies to bypass auto-login issues.

  * Follow the structured steps for linking new accounts through the Brain AI section.

  * Familiarize yourself with Sintra's supported integrations and their capabilities to better align your workflows with its strengths.




These troubleshooting solutions should help you resolve any challenges with Facebook integration in Sintra efficiently.
