Google Drive integration in Sintra allows 2 actions:

  * saving to Google Drive

  * uploading files to Brain AI or Helper chats from the Google drive, instead of the device




This integration does not support accessing or saving files in Google Workspace shared drives, nor does it allow editing or accessing existing Google Drive files. Files can only be saved to designated locations such as the root directory or pre-defined Helper folders.

# Saving to Google Drive 

You can save documents either directly to:

  1. The main (root) Google Drive called "My drive";

  2. (New feature) a Helper's personal generated folder.




You cannot save files through shared links or access files from shared drives, limiting file management to certain locations.

## Saving to the root Google Drive

To save the document or file, simply ask the helper in chat to "save this to Google drive". You can include a file's name that should be set.

You will receive a pop-up that will ask to confirm this action to be done:

Press "Approve" and the file will be saved to your Google Drive.

Note: If you do not receive a pop-up or click "approve" in the pop-up - the information will not be saved.

## Saving to the Helper's personal Google Drive

Our new functionality now also allows Helpers to create their own folder in Google Drive (one folder per Helper). While this does not allow accessing files - it eases locating the files saved by the Helper within the Google Drive itself.

The process is similar to saving to the root Google Drive; however, in order to also create a folder - you also need to create a file at the same time (at least for the first time).

For the first time, use the following prompt: "Save a a file called [insert the name you want this file to be called] and place it in a new folder called [insert the name of this folder]". 

You will receive a similar pop-up:

The "File Name" will display the placement of the file in this sense : [folder name]/[file name].[format]

Simply click "Approve" and then you will have a folder in your Google Drive that will contain a spreadsheet Helpers will be able to access.

To save files to the same folder in the future, simply ask the Helper the following: "Save this file and place it in a folder called [insert the name of this folder]"

# Retrieving files from Google Drive 

Files saved in Google Drive cannot be retrieved by Helpers. In order to retrieve a file that is saved in the Google Drive - you need to upload it directly in the chat. You can do so by either downloading that file to your device and then uploading it to the chat, or simply clicking the paper-clip icon and choosing the option to upload from a Google Drive.

# Troubleshooting Google Drive Integration Issues

If Sintra displays errors like "already connected" during integration:

  1. **Disconnect the Current Google Drive Account:**

     * Navigate to your Brain AI profile.

     * Locate the connected Google Drive account.

     * Click on the “X” icon to disconnect it.

     * Confirm the disconnection when prompted.

  2. **Reconnect Google Drive:**

     * Open Sintra in an incognito browser window.

     * Access the Brain AI page.

     * Click the “Connect” button to link a new Google Drive account.




These steps resolve most integration issues. For unresolved problems, contact support.
