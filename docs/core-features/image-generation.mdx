#### **Can Helpers generate text in the image?**

When generating entirely new images, Sintra provides high-quality results and is especially effective at generating accurate text. Unlike its earlier capabilities, Sintra can now produce clear and readable letters and words directly within the image.

Generate text "SALE 50% OFF" or event flyers with "Join us July 15th" – text now renders perfectly every time.

#### **Can Helpers edit uploaded images?**

When working with existing images, Helpers take an image as a reference and modify it. You can request changes such as adding or editing text, adjusting colors, or altering objects within the image. 

Turn a red car blue, remove photobombers from team photos, or update existing banners.

Edit the background while keeping faces untouched, update text without affecting your brand elements, or change colors while maintaining original quality.

Product mockups look photo-quality, team headshots feel natural, and marketing visuals blend seamlessly with real photos!

Note: When requesting edits to an existing image, be sure to clearly specify what you would like to change.

**What are the image generation limitations?**
