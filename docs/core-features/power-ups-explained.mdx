Each helper has their own set of power-ups. They are specialized micro-AI tools that streamline your workflow by automating specific tasks. You can find power-ups within each helper's chat after clicking the **lightning icon**.

Instead of spending time figuring out how to prompt a Helper or adjusting your requests, Power-ups allow you to complete common tasks quickly and efficiently with minimal input and receiving an instant output.

Power-Ups are task-specific tools that:

  * Generate full, in-depth content with minimal user input

  * Are associated with specific Helpers based on their capabilities

  * Simplify complex tasks into a few input fields




For example, the Social Media Helper (Soshie) has Power-Ups related to social media tasks, such as a LinkedIn Post Generator that creates a complete, ready-to-post update from just a topic input.

**Note:** There are over 90+ Power-Ups available in total.

## Accessing power-ups

Each Helper has their own set of power-ups. To access them:

  1. Open the [Sintra App](https://app.sintra.ai)

  2. Click on a chat with a Helper

  3. Click on the "lightning icon" next to the paperclip icon




You will see a new window with all of that Helper's power-ups listed out. Simply click on one of your choice and wait for the Helper to return their answer!

**Important:** You can only access Power-Ups associated with the Helper plans you have. Users with the Sintra X plan have access to all Helpers and, consequently, all Power-Ups.

## Conclusion

Power-Ups simplify your workflow by providing task-specific tools that require minimal input to generate comprehensive content. By leveraging these tools, you can save time and effort on common tasks associated with each Helper's capabilities.
