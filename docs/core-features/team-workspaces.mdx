T​eam Workspace is an additional paid feature that allows multiple people to use the same:

  * **Brain AI profile** , which acts as a contextual knowledge base for our Helpers. This includes snippets, websites, and files. 

  * **Non-personal account integrations** , which can only be added by the workspace owner. This includes:

    * [Facebook + Instagram integration](https://help.sintra.ai/en/articles/10384189-integrating-your-facebook-instagram-account-to-sintra)

    * [LinkedIn (organization) integration](https://help.sintra.ai/en/articles/10383905-integrating-your-linkedin-organization-account-to-sintra)




**Note:** Facebook + Instagram and LinkedIn integrations currently only allow posting/scheduling posts to project-oriented social media accounts. 

However, it ensures that the following features stay private and separate:

  * Everyone's chats with Helpers - these are accessible only to the account that's used to log in to Sintra with. Other team members will not be able to see your chats.

  * Personal account integrations, which can be added by each Team Workspace member. This includes:

    * [Google (Gmail, Google calendar, Google Drive) integration](https://help.sintra.ai/en/articles/10383940-integrating-your-google-account-to-sintra)

    * [Microsoft (Outlook) integration](https://help.sintra.ai/en/articles/10383990-integrating-your-microsoft-account-to-sintra)

    * [Notion integration](https://help.sintra.ai/en/articles/10384026-integrating-your-notion-account-to-sintra)




## Team Workspace plans and pricing

Team workspace charges for each seat within a workspace rather than each user email. This means that even if you were to add the same email address for a different workspace - you would need to pay the additional seat fee as it's charged not per user email, but per seat for a workspace.

  * **Annual subscription:** $114 per seat annually

  * **Monthly Subscription:** $19 per seat monthly




**Note:** Team Workspace seat is purchased on top of your Sintra app subscription and it will also be charged on a renewal basis, unless you cancel the renewal.

## FAQ

**My colleague and I want to collaborate in a workspace and maintain our personal Sintra subscriptions**

If you both have a Sintra subscription and only want to share one workspace - only one of you should add another as a team member in their workspace to avoid unnecessary charges. There's no way to divide the payment across multiple accounts.

**My colleague and I want to collaborate in multiple workspaces while maintaining our personal Sintra subscriptions**

In case you would like to share multiple workspaces with each other - you will need to pay for each seat within a workspace, even though the accounts may be the same. You can take one of the 2 approaches:

  1. One person pays for multiple Team Workspace seats in separate workspaces;

  2. You both invite each other as Team Workspace members in your own separate Brain AI profiles and pay for the seat separately.
