When you start out using Sintra - you will be guided through an onboarding, during which, information on your business or project is collected and stored in the Brain AI of your first workspace. The first workspace is created by default. Let's dive into what Sintra workspaces are, what types of workspaces exist and how to utilize them!


A workspace in Sintra is your working environment for a single project, client or business. The workspace is designed to gather and store information for one business; hence, if you have multiple projects you want to work on that have separate information, social media or email accounts - you should create separate workspaces for each one to ensure your experience with Sintra is smooth. 

The longer you use and engage in a workspace - the more context is collected on your business and the better the Helpers perform with time.  
​

Each workspace has it's own:

  * Inbox, that shows tasks requiring your input that are related to this workspace.  
​

  * Brain AI profile, which acts as a personalised library and:

    * contains information on your business or project;

    * allows setting up integrations with other platforms.

  * Helpers that are aware only of the context stored in this workspace's Brain AI. [Learn more about Sintra's Helpers](https://help.sintra.ai/en/articles/9607295-sintra-helpers-explained).  
​

  * Chat history of conversations with that specific workspace's Helpers.




# Types of workspaces

In order to create a workspace in Sintra - you must have an active Sintra's subscription. Sintra has 2 workspace types:

  1. Individual workspaces

  2. Team workspaces




All of the workspaces you create under your account by default will be an individual workspace. This means that only you will be able to access it with your email address and password. 

You can always upgrade any workspace to a team workspace, however, that requires purchasing team workspace add-on on top of your existing Sintra subscription. Upgrading to a team workspace allows sharing access to the information stored in the Brain AI as well as to the Helpers, with each added team member, enabling a smoother collaboration. 

People added as team members to a workspace have their own logins and do not have to have a Sintra subscription; however, then they will only be able to access and work in the workspace they were added to since the workspace owner pays for the Sintra subscription as well as their seat in that workspace.

# Multiple workspaces

When you start using Sintra - 1 workspace is created for you by default. Your subscription allows creating up to 5 workspaces under the same account by yourself. Having multiple workspaces is beneficial if you have multiple separate businesses, clients or projects that you want to manage via Sintra.

Separate workspaces have their own knowledge bases, integration connections, and chats with Helpers. Helpers cannot access information between Workspaces, which ensures they don't confuse information when working on tasks.

## Adding a new workspace

New workspaces can be added by you or by our support team. To add a new workspace, do the following:

  1. Click on the workspace icon at the top-left corner;

  2. Click the "+" sign _(note: it won't be visible if you already have 5 workspaces)_

  3. Give the workspace a name and choose a color




That's it - you will have a new workspace created! In case you see the need for more than 5 workspaces - simply reach out to support as we offer additional workspaces for a small monthly subscription fee.

## Removing a workspace

If you wish to remove a workspace, make sure you have more than one as you need to have one workspace at all times. Otherwise the app will not allow removing a workspace.

To remove a workspace, do the following:

  1. Go to the workspace you wish to remove;

  2. Go to the Brain AI tab at [app.sintra.ai/brain](https://app.sintra.ai/brain);

  3. Click "Manage" button above your Brain AI profile card;

  4. Click "Delete Profile"

  5. Confirm this action.




Then the workspace will be removed and you will return to the first available workspace from the workspaces list! Keep in mind that deleted profiles cannot be retrieved.

## **Switching between workspaces**

You can switch between profiles to ensure the AI always references the correct knowledge base for each project. This helps avoid confusion and maintains high-quality responses. To do so, follow the steps bellow:

  1. Click on the workspace icon in the upper-left corner (the only coluored button)

  2. Click on the workspace from the list visible




The workspace icon will change. To double-check if you're in the right workspace - go to the Brain AI tab (brain icon) and you will see the workspace you are in.
