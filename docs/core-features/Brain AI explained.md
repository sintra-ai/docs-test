Brain AI is a powerful feature in Sintra that allows you to create a personalized knowledge base for your Helpers. By adding information to Brain AI, you're essentially building the "brains" of your Workspace and it's Helpers, making them smarter and more tailored to your needs.

## **With Brain AI, you can:**

  * Create up to 5 different Brain AI profiles as separate workspaces _(If you need to have more workspaces - contact support)_

  * Add, edit, search and remove various types of information (text, links, files, images) collected on your business

  * Set up integration connections to different platforms

  * Enhance your Helpers' ability to create personalized, context-rich content




As you add more information to Brain AI, your Helpers become increasingly intelligent, providing more accurate and relevant responses based on your specific context. The guided Brain AI questions generated daily also improve contextually as you expand your Brain AI profiles.

# How to locate Brain AI?

You can find the Brain AI by clicking the brain icon:

  * on the web app it's on the left-side navigation panel;

  * on the iOS app it's at the bottom-right corner




# What can you find in the Brain AI tab?

This is the actual "brain" of the workspace and helpers in the workspace. It's important to keep this section up to date, ensure there's no outdated information to guarantee a smooth and correctly personalised experience. 




## Setting Up Brain AI

  1. Navigate to the [Brain AI page](https://app.sintra.ai/brain) in Sintra App

  2. Create a new profile (give it a name and choose a color)

  3. Add information to your profile

  4. Use the profile with Helpers

  5. Continue to enrich your profile with more information




**Note:** Brain AI is accessible only to users with an active Sintra Plan. Your data remains secure and private, and no third party can access or view it.

## Adding Information to Brain AI

You can add four types of information to your Brain AI profiles:

  * Textual information - it can be either summarised or not, depending on your setting.

  * Webpage links - simply paste in a publicly available URL that should be taken for reference when working on the tasks.

  * Files - you can upload PNG, JPEG and MP4 files that are up to 10MB directly to the Brain.

  * Connections to other platforms - these are obtained via integrations.




Brain AI automatically summarizes and structures textual information for easy reference.

**Pro Tip:** Quickly add information to your Brain AI profile directly from Helper chat by clicking the +brain button near a sent or received message:

#   
Editing and deleting a Brain AI profile

You can edit the name, colour, and delete a Brain AI profile by selecting the "Manage" button above the Brain AI card at <https://app.sintra.ai/brain>.

If you make any changes to the name or the color of the workspace - click Save.

If you wish to delete the workspace - click "Delete" and confirm this action. Keep in mind you must have at least one workspace at all times, hence if you wish to delete a workspace and you only have one - create a new one first.
