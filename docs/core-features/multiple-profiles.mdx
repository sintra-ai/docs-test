Brain AI profiles are like special libraries filled with all the important information about your business and connections to integrated apps.  
​

When you add these knowledge bases to your Sintra AI profile, the Helpers can use these resources to provide in-touch and effective assistance and bring automation to the next level.

You can create up to 5 different profiles for various projects or clients. Switch between them to get more personalized, creative, and accurate results for each profile.

If you need more than 5 profiles - reach out directly to support. We offer additional profiles for a small recurring monthly subscription fee.

## **How Do Brain AI Profiles Work?**

  1. **Upload Information and Add Account Connections** : You can upload documents, files, and other important information about your business to create your Brain AI profiles. Each Brain AI profile can have connections to different accounts on integrated apps. The upper limit for file size is 20MB.

  2. **Integration** : Once uploaded, the information is made available to the helpers as details they can use to personalize their work and make it relevant.

  3. **Utilization** : When your Sintra Helpers are working on a task, they pull relevant information from one of your Brain AI profiles to provide you with accurate and tailored assistance.
