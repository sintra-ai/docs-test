# Home Page

The Home page lists all AI helpers as individual cards. Each card shows the helper’s name (e.g., Penn for copywriting), an avatar and a short description. Some cards display a zap badge in the upper-right corner: this indicates that an automation (not a power-up) is available for that helper. Clicking the main card opens a chat with the helper; clicking the zap badge jumps directly to the automation’s setup page. There is no "+" icon on helper cards anymore.

## Global Input Field

At the very top of the Home page you’ll find a global input field labelled "How can Sintra help you today?" Type any request here—Sintra will automatically route it to the most appropriate helper. To the right of this field is a zap button. Clicking it opens a sheet with all available power-ups, allowing you to run a task without starting a chat manually (e.g., "Create a social media post," "Generate a sales report"). This global input card is the fastest way to get help when you’re not sure which helper to choose.
