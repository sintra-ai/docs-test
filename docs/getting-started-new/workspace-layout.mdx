Once signed in, you land in your workspace. A navigation bar on the left side offers quick access to major modules:

## Navigation Bar Icons

- **Home** (house icon) – displays helper cards.
- **Inbox** (envelope icon with badge) – shows tasks and suggestions.
- **Automations** (slider icon) – lists active automations.
- **Brain AI** (brain icon) – access to all stored knowledge and integrations.
- **History** (clock icon) – search and reopen past conversations.
- **Referral** (gift icon) – opens the referral program.
- **Settings** (gear icon) – manage account details.

Notification badges on the icons show pending tasks (e.g., five messages in Inbox or seven conversations in History). The bar also contains a help button (floating "Help" tab on the right) that opens the support chat.
