Sintra operates as a web-only application. New users create an account on Sintra's marketing site. Existing users can navigate to app.sintra.ai and choose from two sign-in methods:

## Sign-in Methods

### Email & Password
Enter the email you used to purchase your subscription along with your password and click Sign in.

### Sign in with Google
Click the Sign in with Google button and authenticate with the Google account associated with your subscription.

Once authenticated, you'll be taken to your workspace. Accounts are tied to an email address and support multi-user collaboration; there is currently no mobile app.
