Brain AI can pull data from external sources. On the right side of the Brain AI page youâ€™ll see Integrations cards. As of August 2025 the available integrations are:

## Available Integrations

### LinkedIn (Personal)
Connect your personal LinkedIn profile to read posts and publish updates on your behalf (you can manage posts directly from helpers). A green "Connected" badge appears when linked.

### LinkedIn (Organization)
Link your company page to allow Sintra to publish posts on behalf of your organization (requires admin rights).

### Facebook + Instagram
Connect a Facebook Page and associated Instagram account to enable publishing and comment replies via automations.

These cards include a Connect button (or show Connected if already linked). 

## Additional Integrations

Additional integrations (such as Gmail, Outlook and calendars) are accessible during automation setup (e.g., Daily Summarizer) rather than through the Brain AI page. Connecting any of these services lets Sintra read and write data as needed for helpers and automations.
