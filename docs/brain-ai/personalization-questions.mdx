# Answering Personalization Questions

At the bottom of the Brain AI page you may see a button labeled Answer questions. Clicking it opens a modal that asks about your business (e.g., "What are your main products or services?") with options to answer, skip or mark as private. 

Answering these questions helps Sintra tailor its responses and suggestions; the app tracks how many remain (e.g., "30 left").
