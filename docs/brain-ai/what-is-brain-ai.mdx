Brain AI is your personal knowledge base. It stores information about your business and uses it to personalize helper responses. The knowledge base contains snippets, webpages and media files (images and videos). The top of the Brain AI page displays counts for each type of content.

## Note

Earlier builds included a link to a public "knowledge site," but this feature is under development and not currently available. Treat all knowledge as private unless explicitly shared through integrations or automations.
