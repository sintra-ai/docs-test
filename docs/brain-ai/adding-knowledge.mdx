# Adding Knowledge

Click the Add button to open the Add Knowledge side panel. It has three tabs:

## Memory

Paste plain text into a field; optionally toggle Summarize to have Sintra generate a summary before saving; toggle Donâ€™t use publicly to keep it private.

## Webpage

Enter a URL; Sintra will fetch the page and store it as a knowledge item (for news articles or blog posts).

## Files & Media

Upload PNG, JPG or MP4 files up to 10 MB. After uploading, Sintra will extract text (for images) or metadata and add it to the knowledge base.
