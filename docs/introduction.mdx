Sintra is a digital assistant platform that combines multiple AI "helpers," a central Brain AI knowledge base and several automation workflows. It is designed to streamline business processes ranging from customer support and copywriting to data analysis, recruitment and social media management. Each helper is specialized for a particular domain (e.g., Cassie handles support queries, Dexter performs data analysis, Penn writes copy). Users interact with helpers through chat-like conversations and can customize the tone, length and language of responses.

## Key Features

### AI Helpers
12+ helpers, each with a unique persona and skill set. They can draft emails, write blog posts, analyze data, brainstorm product ideas, perform SEO audits and more.

### Brain AI
A knowledge management module that stores snippets, webpages and media; it personalizes helper responses based on your business information and integrates with external accounts.

### Automations
Three beta workflows—Facebook Auto Commenter, Social Media Manager and Daily Summarizer—that run on schedules or monitor external channels.

### Inbox & History
A unified inbox for tasks generated by helpers and automations, plus a history panel for past conversations.

### Settings & Billing
A page for personal details, language preferences, password management, subscription plan and experimental features.

### Referral Program
A simple program where users share a code to give and get free months.

This documentation will walk you through each of these components.
