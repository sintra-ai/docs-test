## Define your tone early
Use conversation settings to set the vibe (formal vs. casual), message length and language for each helper. Consistency across helpers helps maintain brand voice.

## Use custom instructions
Provide clear, concise guidelines in each chat or automation (e.g., "Use inclusive language and avoid slang"). This greatly improves output quality.

## Organize your knowledge
Upload product descriptions, policy documents and FAQs into Brain AI. Toggle Summarize for long documents to extract key points. Remove outdated knowledge to avoid conflicting responses.

## Review automation drafts
All automations require your approval before sending replies or publishing posts. Always check drafts in the Inbox or Social Media Manager calendar to ensure accuracy and tone.

## Monitor Beta features
Because automations are in Beta, expect occasional bugs. Report issues through the help chat and vote on feature requests to influence the roadmap.
