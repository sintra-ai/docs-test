# FAQ & Troubleshooting

## How do I add more helpers?
Currently the helper roster is fixed; new helpers may be added over time. Follow the release notes and feature-request board for updates.

## Why can’t I edit my name or email?
Personal details are locked for security reasons. Use the Help & Support chat to request changes.

## My automation isn’t working. What should I do?
First verify that all required integrations (LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.) are connected. Then ensure the automation is toggled on in the Automations page and any required setup is complete. If issues persist, contact support.

## What’s the difference between power-ups and automations?
Power-ups run inside chats and are accessed via the zap icon in the chat input field. Automations are separate products with dashboards and schedules. Automations always require setup and may rely on integrations, whereas power-ups execute instantly within a conversation.

## Where can I suggest improvements?
Use the Request a feature option under Settings to access the public wishlist. Upvote existing ideas or create a new request.

## Is my data private?
All knowledge stored in Brain AI is private by default. There is currently no public knowledge page. Sintra states that your data is secure and only used to personalize responses; refer to the company’s privacy policy for details.

## How can I get help quickly?
Use the Help & Support chat widget (accessible from Settings) to ask questions, report issues, or request a refund.
