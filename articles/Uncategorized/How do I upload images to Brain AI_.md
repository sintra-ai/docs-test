To upload images to Brain AI:

  1. Go to **Brain AI**.

  2. Scroll down to the **"All Knowledge"** section.

  3. Click the **"+add"** button.

  4. Choose your JPEG or PNG files (up to **10MB worth** of images at a time).

  5. Make sure to give each image a clear, specific **title** â€”this is how you'll reference it later when creating posts with Soshie.




ðŸ’¡ **Pro tip:** Use **[labels]** in the file name (e.g., `[concerts] fall recital.jpg`) to keep your library organized.
