  1. Helpers can only retrieve summaries from Brain AI - not full files. In order for a Helper to reflect upon a full file - it needs to be uploaded to the Helper chat directly.  
â€‹  
Keep in mind our Helpers memory is limited to 65 thousand characters, meaning that if you upload a file containing more characters than that - the Helper will not retrieve the full file, even though it may be less than 20MB in size.




Essentially, we do not provide a functionality that would allow Helpers to retrieve a full file upon request.
