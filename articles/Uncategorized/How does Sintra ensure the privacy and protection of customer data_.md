# How does Sintra ensure the privacy and protection of customer data?

## Introduction

Sintra is committed to safeguarding customer data by implementing robust security measures and adhering to strict privacy protocols. This article outlines how Sintra ensures data privacy and protection while providing transparency about its practices.

## Security Measures

Sintra employs advanced security measures to protect customer information at every stage:

  * **Encryption in Transit and at Rest** : Sintra uses the TLS protocol (1.2 or higher) to ensure secure HTTPS communication. Additionally, where feasible, Sintra encrypts data at rest to offer another layer of protection.

  * **Role-Based Access Control** : Strict access controls are enforced, requiring user authentication through hashed credentials and unique user IDs. These controls ensure that only authorized personnel can access sensitive information.

  * **Monitoring Tools** : Sintra utilizes tools such as activity logs, intrusion detection systems, and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions to identify and mitigate potential threats.




## Data Retention and Minimization Policies

Sintra follows stringent policies to manage data responsibly:

  * **Data Retention** : Customer data is retained only as long as necessary to provide services or comply with legal obligations. Sintra offers the option to permanently delete requested data within 30 days.
