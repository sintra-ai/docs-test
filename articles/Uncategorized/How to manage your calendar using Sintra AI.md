To start managing your calendar with Sintra, you will have to connect the calendar integrations first. Currently, Sintra supports these calendar platforms:

  * [Gmail](https://help.sintra.ai/en/articles/10383940-integrating-your-google-account-to-sintra)

  * [Outlook](https://help.sintra.ai/en/articles/10383990-integrating-your-microsoft-account-to-sintra)

# Create events in chat

After your integration with either Google or Outlook is complete, you can use Vizzy's chatbox to create events in chat. Vizzy can either create one-time events or recurring events, depending on your needs.

**Note:** When asking Vizzy to create an event, make sure to mention the platform you want to use, e.g. - Gmail or Outlook. Otherwise, Vizzy will create events for both platforms.

## Create a one-time event

To create a one-time event, simply provide Vizzy with the date and time that you need. Include the subject name and any description that should be added:

## Create a recurring event

To create a recurring event, you will need to include the same information as a one-time event. This time, however, make sure to include the frequency of recurrence:

## Add attendees to your event

If you're creating meetings with others through Sintra, you can automatically send them an invitation when the event is created. Simply mention the email of the attendee that you want to add:

**Tip:** If you're using Google Calendar as your main platform, you can create Google Meet calls by requesting it in the same message.

## How to read and approve the event

From the previous pictures, you may have noticed a window that appears after you make your request. This window is called a function window, and it appears whenever you have to make an approval for an action. Inside it, you will see all the relevant information for your request:  
​

  * **Summary** \- The summary is the calendar event title

  * **Description** \- The description of the event

  * **Start and end times** \- Date and time for the event

  * **Attendees** \- Attendees who will receive an invitation email

  * **Recurrence** \- How often the event will recur

  * **Provider** \- The platform that will be used to save the event (Google or Outlook)

  * **Google Meet Call** \- If a Google Meet call link will be created with the invitation (Google Calendar only)




If all the event details fit your needs, press the "**Approve** " button. On a successful creation, the function windows will retract, and a green checkmark will be placed:

The event will be created inside your calendar, and you will be able to see it on the platform of your choice!

**Notice:** Currently, both the Google and Outlook calendar windows have the same icon. Please check the provider before approving the event creation.

# Read past or future events in chat

Vizzy also has the ability to read your events inside both platforms. Vizzy can filter your events by date or keyword depending on your needs.

**Limitation:** At this time, only the Google integration supports these features:

  * Reading calendar events by keyword.

  * Reading secondary calendar events.

  * Reading recurring events.




## Reading events by date

When making your request for Vizzy, simply include the exact date or date range for the events to be found. A request to check for next week's event would look like this:  
​

If you wanted to check your events from the past week, the request would look like this:   
​

**Tip:** If you have a lot of events that happen each month, Vizzy may have issues processing all that information and returning you a summary. Try dividing your request into weekly ranges for better efficiency.

## Reading events by keyword

If you want to find when specific events happen inside your calendar, you can search for them by using keywords. For example, keywords may help you check for the latest call or meeting that is upcoming:

## Reading secondary calendar events

Sintra also supports reading secondary calendar events. These events are usually birthdays or other types of events that were not created under your main account calendar. Inside Google Calendar, secondary calendars will be shown below your name (Tasks not included):

An example of a birthday request would look like this:
