Sintra offers flexible and generous discount programs that help customers save significantly on subscriptions. Whether you're a new subscriber, upgrading your plan, or reactivating a previous subscription, this guide explains how Sintra discounts work, how long they last, and how to troubleshoot common issues.

# Discount eligibility

Sintra discounts are only available through subscriptions purchased directly on the Sintra website. Subscriptions via third-party platforms (like the Apple App Store) are not eligible for these discounts.

These discounts are available for both monthly and annual plans that are purchased via Sintra website.

## **Keeping your discount when upgrading to a different plan**

If you start with a discounted monthly plan and later switch to an annual plan, your discount will continue without interruption. Here’s how it works:

  * Any amount already paid is typically applied as a credit toward the upgraded plan.

  * You’ll only be charged the remaining balance after applying this credit.

  * No need to re-enter your discount—Sintra carries it over automatically.




If you encounter billing issues during an upgrade, such as a missing discount or unexpected charges, contact Sintra support for assistance.

# Discount duration

Discounts obtained via Sintra website are designed to remain active for a subscription as long as the subscription is active and uninterrupted.

# **Frequently asked questions (FAQs)**
