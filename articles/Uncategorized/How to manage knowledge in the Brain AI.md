Since the Brain AI is the actual brain of your workspace _(**[read more about what Brain AI is and how it works](https://help.sintra.ai/en/articles/9607409-brain-ai-explained)**)_ and with time more and more information is collected there on your business - it's essential to understand, how to manage all of this information.

While the Brain AI contains more sections, the information that is constantly referred to is only in the "All Knowledge" section. First, let's understand, what types and formats of information sources are supported:

  1. Textual information - currently the Brain AI supports only snippets for textual context. _If you see a need in a different type of textual information source,**[fill in a feature request to our product team](https://help.sintra.ai/en/articles/10892341-how-to-submit-feature-requests-to-sintra-ai)**._  
​

  2. Webpage links - currently, only publicly available URLs will provide additional context to the Helpers.  
​

  3. Files - you can upload PNG, JPEG and MP4 files that are up to 10MB directly to the Brain. other file types aren't supported. _If you see a need in a different file format that would be beneficial for you,**[fill in a feature request to our product team](https://help.sintra.ai/en/articles/10892341-how-to-submit-feature-requests-to-sintra-ai)**._




This means that even though you can set up integrations in the Brain AI and you are able to perform certain actions via them - these integrations do not provide context to the helpers automatically. Only the information saved as a snippet, website link or a file in the Brain AI is referenced consistently or, in other words, the information in "All knowledge" section:

Now, let's dive into the knowledge management!

# Viewing existing information in the Brain AI

To view the knowledge collected on your business so far, navigate to the "All Knowledge" section in the Brain AI tab. Initially, you will see all of the knowledge gathered so far. However, if you wish to look for a specific knowledge piece, here you will be able to do so by:

  1. **Searching for information** according to keywords that exist in website links, snippet text, image titles or descriptions **by clicking the magnifying-glass icon** and typing in the keywords you're looking for;  
​

  2. Filtering information according to the type of the knowledge _(Knowledge Types: Memory snippet, webpage link, file, image, video)_ as well as privacy type _(Knowledge privacy types: all, private, public)_  
​

# Adding information to the Brain AI

If you want to add information to Brain AI, you can do so in multiple ways:

  1. Adding information manually

  2. Asking a Helper to save to Brain AI

  3. Saving messages directly from chat with a click of a button




Keep in mind that saving information by requesting a Helper to do it will result in a summarised memory snippet of the information. If you wish to keep exact phrasing and length - save it manually or with a click of a button instead. Always verify the summarized snippet to ensure it accurately reflects all necessary information before proceeding.

## Adding knowledge manually to Brain AI

To add knowledge on your business manually to Brain AI, do the following:

  1. Go to the Brain AI tab

  2. Find "All Knowledge" section

  3. Click "+ Add"

  4. Choose the Knowledge type, add information and click "Add"




## Asking a Helper to save knowledge to Brain AI

You can also save knowledge on your project by asking a Helper to do it. Simply ask the helper to "save to brain" and they will do it! You will see a green checkmark indicating that the information was saved to Brain AI:

If you wish to revert this action, simply click "undo". 

**Note:** When using the save-to-brain feature, it's recommended to check that the summary contains all necessary details. For important or complex information, consider using the manual save feature to avoid any loss of context or precision.

## Saving knowledge directly from chat with a click of a button

You can also click a Brain icon next to your own message or the output of a Helper:

This will instantly save the whole message to "All Knowledge" section in the Brain AI.  
​

# Editing information added to the Brain AI

To edit information saved in the Brain AI, simply locate the information bit you want to edit, click on it and adjust the fields available. You will be able to edit the title and description for images and knowledge snippets, whereas, website links only have one field.

Once you're done editing the knowledge bit - click save.

# Deleting information added to the Brain AI

To delete information saved in the Brain AI, simply locate the information bit you want to edit, click on it, make sure you wish to delete and then click "delete." You will not need to confirm this action - the information will be permanently deleted right away without the ability to revert this action.

# Best practices for Brain AI information management

To effectively manage information within Brain AI:

  1. Use manual saving for detailed and important information that needs exact preservation.

  2. Rely on Helper-assisted saving for quick summaries when exact wording isn't critical.

  3. Always verify saved snippets for accuracy, especially when using the automated saving features.

  4. Structure your input clearly when asking Helpers to save information

  5. Give explicit commands to store information, as Brain AI does not save all chat data by default.

  6. Audit the information stored in the Brain AI in the "All Knowledge" section, especially, if the Helpers are returning false information: the Brain AI is the main source of information on your business; hence, if the Helper is providing outdated information - it's most likely placed amongst the snippets or linked pages.




Following these practices will help ensure proper system functionality, reduce errors, and make retrieval of information more efficient in future sessions.
