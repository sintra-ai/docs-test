No — once an image is used in a Social Media Manager post, it is considered **“used once”** and will **not be automatically reused again**. This helps prevent repetitive visuals in your scheduled content. If you want to use the same image again in future posts, you’ll need to **either re-upload it** or **manually reference it in Soshie chat**.
