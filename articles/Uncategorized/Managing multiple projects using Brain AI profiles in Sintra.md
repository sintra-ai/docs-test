Managing multiple projects with Sintra's Brain AI requires organizing information using separate profiles designed for distinct purposes. This guide explains how to optimize and utilize multiple Brain AI profiles to maintain clarity and avoid confusion while working on multiple projects. Before you dive in, we recommend **[familiarising with Sintra AI workspaces](https://help.sintra.ai/en/articles/11704889-sintra-ai-workspaces-explained)** first.

# How to manage multiple businesses or projects using Sintra?

Create separate Brain AI workspaces to manage multiple businesses or projects. This will ensure that your data remains organized and distinct. 

Brain AI profiles, also called workspaces, provide a way to separate and manage knowledge for different projects or clients. Each profile acts as its own knowledge base, ensuring that information remains isolated and tailored to specific needs. 

Moreover, it expands with time and allows your Helpers to execute tasks according to the information collected on your business. When managed effectively, profiles prevent data blending that could lead to underperformance of the AI.

# Managing information on multiple businesses or projects

Ensuring the information is up to date and relevant in a Brain AI workspace ensures that you get tailored solutions for different clients or business models.

Overall, managing information across various businesses is efficient and straightforward. Users can leverage the Brain AI tab to edit or organize specific business data, **[learn how to manage knowledge in Brain AI](https://help.sintra.ai/en/articles/11758256-how-to-manage-knowledge-in-the-brain-ai)**.

# Subscription features and profile limits

With a standard Sintra subscription, you are entitled to create and use up to 5 distinct Brain AI profiles. Each profile serves exclusively as an independent workspace designed to maintain separate contexts for distinct projects. If you require more than five profiles, simply reach out to our customer support team and they will assist you with this. However, for most users, careful planning ensures that the default profile limit suffices.

# Best practices for organizing workspaces

To ensure each profile contains only accurate and relevant information for the specific business or project and overall a smooth experience when managing multiple projects or businesses, follow these practices:

  1. **Separate unrelated topics:** Ensure that topics or types of information significantly different from one another are stored in separate Brain AI profiles. This prevents overlapping data from degrading AI performance. For example, combining client A’s data with client B’s in the same profile would lead to inaccurate recommendations and task execution.

  2. **Keep information centralised:** If the information or knowledge base primarily revolves around the same project or client, keep it within a single profile. This minimizes unnecessary separation and keeps data cohesive and easy to manage. For example, if client A provides X and Y services - keep this information in the same profile, simply give clear titles for the information snippets.

  3. **Regularly assess profile efficiency:** Periodically evaluate your profiles to determine if any outdated or inactive workspaces can be merged, archived, or deleted to streamline operations.

  4. **Regularly audit Brain AI knowledge:** Evaluate if all of the information in the Workspace's Brain AI is not outdated, if some information changed - edit it manually. **[Learn how to manage information in Brain AI](https://help.sintra.ai/en/articles/11758256-how-to-manage-knowledge-in-the-brain-ai)**.




By following these guidelines, you can ensure Brain AI remains a highly efficient and organized tool for managing multiple projects with precision.
