The correct process to add images into the Brain AI library:

  1. Navigate to **Brain AI**.

  2. Scroll down to **All Knowledge**.

  3. Click **+add** and select JPEG/PNG files (under 10MB).

  4. Title your images clearly, using **[labels]** if helpful.

  5. Optional: Create **Snippets** to define your labels for better organization.




Your images will then be stored and searchable for post creation.
