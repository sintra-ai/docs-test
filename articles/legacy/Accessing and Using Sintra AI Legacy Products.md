## **Sintra Max Bundle**

By purchasing Sintra Bots, you are buying a ready-made downloadable bot JSON file, which you can import into make.com, along with a ready-made setup guide. These bots can complete specific tasks completely on autopilot, on a set schedule, while the helpers perform tasks on demand.

In order to start using Sintra Bots, you would need to create a[ make.com](http://make.com/) account first. This can be done free of charge and Make is free to use for up to 1,000 operations per month. Once you go above that, you only pay per the operations you use to Make: <https://www.make.com/en/pricing>

Additionally, you should have access to OpenAI API credits to use the GPT model of your preference in the bot configuration. Credits are available for purchase at <https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/overview>.
