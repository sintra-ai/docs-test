While your data is encrypted in transit, we recommend taking precautions when it comes to sensitive and confidential data you would like to upload in your chats with helpers, power-up material and Brain AI.

Before uploading files, remove or change personal and sensitive details, if possible. This allows the helper to process raw data without concern of biases or incidents in case of a security flaw.
