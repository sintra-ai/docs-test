Let's dive into each of the tabs!

## Workspaces

The first button in the navigation bar is the only colored one and displays the workspace you are in. If you click on this button you can easily:

  1. See the list of workspaces associated with your account

  2. See the workspace you are in

  3. Create a new workspace (if you have less than 5 workspaces)




Separate workspaces have their own knowledge bases, integration connections, and chats with Helpers. Helpers cannot access information between Workspaces, which ensures they don't confuse information when working on tasks.

## Home Page

The home page can be identified by the home icon. It's your starting point featuring:

  * A search bar

  * Your helpers

The search bar is located at the top side of the screen. Use the search bar to describe a task. You can even attach material to the prompt for additional context and you will be directed to the Helper, that's most qualified for it, out of all of the available helpers! This feature is similar to sending a message directly to a Helper, but instead of having to choose a Helper - it's decided for you. **(add link) Learn how to use the search bar functionality**.

To interact with a helper, simply click on its card to open the dedicated Helper chat interface.

Starting from the bottom-left of the screen - you will find a message box. Similarly to the search bar - this is the space to start working on a task to together with a Helper and provide context to them. In the chat box, you can find the following buttons:

  * **Paperclip icon** \- after clicking this, you can attach files to the message you will send. This will provide additional context to the Helper.
